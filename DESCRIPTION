Description: Data are partitioned (clustered) into k clusters "around medoids", which is
    a more robust version of K-means implemented in the function pam() in the 'cluster' package.
    The PAM algorithm is described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) <doi:10.1002/9780470316801>.
    Please refer to the pam() function documentation for more references.
    Clustered data is plotted as a split heatmap allowing visualisation of representative
    "group-clusters" (medoids) in the data as separated fractions of the graph while those
    "sub-clusters" are visualised as a traditional heatmap based on hierarchical clustering.
